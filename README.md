Anaplan Test Challenge - Spotify API
=========================================

Interview preparation
---------------------
Before your technical interview, we'd like you to clone this repo and do some preparation work.

This is a skeleton Cucumber/Java test framework which we'd like you to use to write tests during the technical interview.

You will be using the Spotify API for this testing challenge.


Pre-interview setup
---------------------
During the interview you will be testing some API endpoints that Spotify have. However, there is some authorisation setup that takes some time and would be good to get done and prepared before the live technical test in the interview.

Please review this guide on how to authorise with Spotify and retrieve an authorisation token that you can use for subsequent calls:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide

We'd like to see this in a step or a Before hook in your implementation of this test framework. We have provided our Spotify account's Basic Auth token in the Candidate Pack you were emailed. You may use any HTTP library you wish for the API calls in this tech test.

Doing this beforehand will save time in the interview, enabling you to showcase your test-writing skills and decision-making. Don't worry if you don't quite manage to do this; we can help you out during the interview if you need it. Just get as far as you can.
